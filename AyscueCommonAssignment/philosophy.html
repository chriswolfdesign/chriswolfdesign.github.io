                <u>Student-Centered Education</u>
            </div>
            <p>
                I best align with the Student-Center Philosophy because I feel
                if you are not teaching to better your teaching, there is no
                reason to be teaching.  I personally believe students have the
                right to decide who they want to be as people and our jobs as
                educators is to help them achieve that persona.  The reason I
                fit Student-Center instead a specific philosophy is because just
                as we intend to shape students to be well-rounded members of
                society, our philosophy must be stemmed from a variety of
                ideas.  It is also important for your educational philosophy
                to fit your personality.  Young students are receptive when a
                teacher is not acting genuinely.  If we intend to create an
                environment were students feel safe to be themselves, we must
                be role models in that regard.  I will display this philosophy
                by attentively analyzing student behavior and success.  If I
                notice falling behind, I will speak with the student to attempt
                to determine the issue and discuss possible solutions.
                Similarly, if a student is showing proficiency on their
                material, I will discuss possible lessons with their parents
                to provide their child with additional individual attention.

                A large part of my philosophy is that musical education
                enhances other branches of education and strengthens students'
                minds.  Please take a few minutes to watch the below video
