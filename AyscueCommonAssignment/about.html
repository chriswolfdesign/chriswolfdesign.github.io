                <u>My Reason</u>
            </div>
            <p>
                I teach for the feeling I get when a student finally understands
                what we have been working on in class.  I teach to help spread
                music to the world.  I teach to share my love of music with
                children.  I teach to give every child I teach an opportunity
                to become the best versions of themselves they can be.  The
                most important reason that I teach, I learned from a renowned
                band director, Scott Rush.  Mr. Rush said "The truth is,
                what we do is about making music and using music to affect
                young lives." <sup>1</sup>  So the most important reason I
                teach is to make music and share that experience with my
                students.
            </p>

                <u>Purpose of Education</u>
            </div>
            <p>
                The purpose of education is to give knowledge to children
                and help shape them into successful and productive members of
                society.  It is important in the world today because without
                education we will have ignorance in the world.  As long as we
                live, we need to strive to give children an education to make
                them strong members of society and good people.  We should not
                strive for good test scores; that is not the value of education.
                Education should not be based on numbers because intelligence
                is not based on statistics.  Education must be derived from the
                drive and willingness children have to learn because once we
                instill those values into them, education finally becomes about
                the individual, how the individual learns, and how they can
                pursue life-long learning.

                <u>Who I am</u>
            </div>
            <p>
                I see myself as the leader of my classroom.  This is necessary
                when I have 3+ young musicians looking to me for guidance to
                achieving success on their instrument.  In my school, I am a
                leader because I can inspire at least one person a day to be
                their best through musical excellence.  In my community, I am a
                leader because I work to acquire better funding and support for
                the arts so all students can experience the beauty of making
                music.

            <div class="paragraph-header">
                My Approach
            </div>
            <p>
                I as an educator will have a growth mindset in the classroom.
                To accomplish this, I will use "The Seven Habits of Highly
                Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey<sup>2</sup> to help shape
                my educational approach.  The Habits are a great way to
                structure your classroom because these are methods I have seen
                achieve success.
