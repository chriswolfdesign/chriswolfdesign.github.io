        <h1><b><u><i>Current Issues in Education</i></u></b></h1>

        <p>
            There are many concerns in the current educational practices in the
            United States but the most well-known is funding.  Especially
            funding for the arts.  When school districts reduce funding, the
            arts programs are normally the first to suffer.  This is
            counter-productive; research has proven that young students who
            study the arts display greater brain activity and higher academics
            in other fields.  "Students with art rich education have higher
            grade point averages, score better on standardized tests, and
            have lower drop-out rates."<sup>1</sup>  As a music educator, this
            greatly affects me because I could lose my position due to lack of funding.
            However, we do not have to wait and do nothing.  As educators, we
            must be advocates of our passion and educate not only our students,
            but our communities, about the importance to a well-rounded,
            quality education.  The arts are a valuable experience and must
            be offered to all students regardless of social status, ethnicity,
            religious preferences, and any other differences.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a lone educator, I can only do so much.  But as a community,
            we can give our next generation the education they need and
            deserve.
