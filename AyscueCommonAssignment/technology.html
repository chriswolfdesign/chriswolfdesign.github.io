        <h1><b><u><i>Technology in the Classroom</i></u></b></h1>

        <p>
            Technology has offered educators a wide variety of new tools to use
            in their classrooms.  They allow us to communicate with students
            in ways that fit their 21<sup>st</sup> century lifestyle and can
            reinforce techniques they will use outside of the classroom.  Below,
            I will discuss three technologies I plan to use in the classroom to
            aid my students learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            DISCLAIMER: While technology can greatly assist educators it is
            important to note that technology cannot and will not replace
            researched and confirmed best pedagogical practices.
        </p>
    <p><u>Technology I: SmartMusic</u></p>
    <p>
        SmartMusic is an online program that allows students to receive
        immediate feedback on their performance when their director is not
        available.  SmartMusic also allows the educator to set playing tests
        to be given an infinite number of trails, allowing students to take the
        test as many times as needed to demonstrate mastery of the piece's
        concepts.  This permits directors to not only access mastery but also
        assess the equally important concept of growth.  A more recent
        accomplishment of SmartMusic is their adjustment towards a browser-based
        client.  With the recent interest school districts have had in
        Chromebooks, this allows these schools to continue using SmartMusic.
        This also allows students to access SmartMusic from their own computers
        at home.

    <p><u>Technology II: PowerPoint</u></p>
    <p>
        PowerPoint is a cliche tool for educators but for good reason.
        PowerPoints can be used to display information in a concise way for
        students to have easy access. However, the overuse of this technology
        can cause the learning experience to become stagnant and lose student
        interest.  I have found a successful balance to be using PowerPoint
        to display the rehearsal schedule on the board.  This allows students
        to prepare their materials for rehearsal in an organized way but shifts
        the focus to music making once rehearsal starts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below, I provide an example of using PowerPoint as a rehearsal
        scheduling tool.

    <p><u>Technology III: Tonal Energy</u></p>
    <p>
        Tonal Energy is a mobile app that students can use to tune their
        instruments, assess their rhythmic accuracy, and even record themselves
        to listen and judge their own musical phrasing and shaping.  While
        Tonal Energy Pro does cost a marginal amount, they do offer a free
        version with advertisements.  Tonal Energy is current available for
        Android and iOS devices.
