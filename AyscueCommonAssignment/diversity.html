            Since taking EDCI, I have learned that there are many things about
            diversity that I have not yet learned and I should continue studying
            so when I teach, I can ensure I am doing my best as an educator
            to include all students in the classroom culture.  Diversity is an
            important concept to understand as a teacher because it helps me
            ensure students feel safe, welcome, and appreciated in my classroom.
            Without attention to diversity, educators can unintentionally be
            insensitive to students' opinions and needs.  Through this course,
            I have learned to focus on learning about a variety of cultures
            and ethnic backgrounds to create a more cohesive and progressive
            educational experience for my students.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an educator with a new awareness of diversity, I have learned
            to be more aware of what my students are experiencing, inside and
            outside of my classroom.  An important goal for any teacher is to
            encourage students to feel comfortable approaching us with their
            own thoughts and opinions, including: culture, ethnicity, sexual
            orientation, and race.  These topics, while sensitive, are a large
            part of our students lives and it is our responsibility as educators
            to help them navigate through these difficulties.  All students
            must be given the same opportunities in the classroom regardless of
            traits that may make them different from others.  These differences
            must be celebrated, not rejected.
        </p>

            As a music educator, I must include diversity into my curriculum.
            The most obvious way to accomplish this is through performance of
            pieces derived from a variety of cultures and backgrounds.  Each
            year, I will have students choose a piece from our repertoire and
            discuss the culture the piece was inspired by and what they believe
            the composer was attempting to accomplish in their composition.
            Music is a wonderful vehicle to explore the world because music
            transcends human language.  All cultures have their own musical
            history and I am obligated as a music educator to share this beauty
            with my students.
